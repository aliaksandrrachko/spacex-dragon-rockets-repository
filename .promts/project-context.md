# SpaceX Dragon Rockets Repository - Project Context

## Project Overview
This is a Java-based coding exercise project focused on SpaceX Dragon rockets, built with Gradle and following standard Java project conventions.

## Project Structure
- **Language**: Java
- **Build Tool**: Gradle (multi-project build)
- **Main Module**: `core` - contains the primary application logic
- **Package Structure**: `io.github.aliaksandrrachko.*` namespace
- **Build Logic**: Custom convention plugins in `build-logic/`

## Development Guidelines
- Follow Google Java coding standards: https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html
- Use minimal, focused implementations
- Maintain clean separation between main and test code
- Leverage Gradle's convention plugins for consistent builds

## Key Directories
- `core/src/main/java/` - Main application source code
- `core/src/test/java/` - Unit tests
- `build-logic/` - Custom Gradle convention plugins
- `.promts/` - Q CLI prompts and project documentation

## When Working on This Project
- Focus on SpaceX Dragon rocket-related functionality
- Keep implementations minimal and efficient
- Follow the existing package structure under `io.github.aliaksandrrachko`
- Use appropriate Java patterns and conventions
- Consider this as a coding exercise/demonstration project
